# atmMachine
This was a simple react project that is designed to mimic a real ATM machine.

Improvements made to this project include several features. The styling has been set to be centered on the page as well as other cosmetic changes.

Programatically, the "submit button" was removed from the app entirely. It made no sense to have to click multiple buttons, when a single button could do the job.
Now, instead, you set your total you'd like to deposit or withdrawal and click 'deposit' or 'withdrawal' and the total will reflect what you have input.

You also cannot put the number deposited or withdrawn below zero. This is confusing to leave in so it should be removed.

Also, you cannot withdrawal more than you have in you balance. If you attempt to do so, you recieve an alert that you have insufficient funds.
